\begin{abstract}
Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that enables users to communicate in a trust-less manner. 
The most prominent change brought by this technology is the mode of business between organizations: they do not need anymore a trusted third party. 
It is a distributed ledger technology based on a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. 
Since Bitcoin was deployed, many blockchain systems have been born with more capabilities, which have allowed them to fit many
different use cases. Smart Contracts, which are programs running on blockchain systems, could extend the potentiality of blockchain
from a platform for financial transactions to an all-purpose utility.
The development of innovative and prominent applications is a consequence of them, such as NFT marketplaces, music royalty tracking, supply chain and logistics monitoring, voting mechanism, 
cross-border payments, and many others.
Finding bugs and vulnerabilities in them is necessary for assuring their correct behaviour. 
This paper deals with the way for finding the vulnerabilities in Ethereum blockchain-based smart contracts. We review related works regarding 
the classification of the most common vulnerabilities and tools which support their detection.

\section{Introduction}
Nowadays, the major platform for decentralized decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) 
and applications (dApps) is Ethereum. It can be described as the "internet of Blockchain".
Its ecosystem consists of the underlying blockchain, a large
variety of smart contracts deployed on it, a wide range of
valuable assets. 

This growing technology has attaracted many investors, indeed, according \href{https://www.coingecko.com/}{CoinGeko}, 
the crypto market's value is standing around \$2 trillion.
On the other hand, interest in such a market has grown even among malicious attackers. 
Attacks such as the “Parity Wallet Hack” and the “Decentralized Autonomous Organization Attack” cost millions of dollars simply because of 
naive bugs in the smart contract code. Blockchain and smart contract technologies have multiple aims, but unfortunately, new applications 
based on them still contain bugs and multiple vulnerabilities, which cause 
several issues for the end-users. Most of the use of this technology relates to finance or certifications, therefore integrity, 
authentication and authorisation in transactions are mandatory. 

The research field behind blockchain technology is growing, as well as the one concerning 
its security and accordingly, many analysis tools were developed. 
These incorporate various strategies for performing the analyses, concerning the technical aspects of smart contracts, 
so these would work differently according to the object of the analysis. 

Among the many aspects of smart contract, our systematic
literature review focuses on studies related to vulnerabilities and 
analysis tools for their detection. We will try to give an answer to the following 
research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which are the main vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts?
    \item Which methodologies are implemented by analysis tools?
    \item How should we behave for the detection of Vulnerabilities?
\end{itemize}

In Section \ref{RelatedWorks}, we compare the actual papers and works regarding this topic. 
Section \ref{Vulnerabilities} explains the objective of our analysis: Smart Contracts Vulnerabilities. 
We give a taxonomy for the main vulnerabilities regarding Solidity. The classification of analysis tools 
is shown in Section \ref{Tools}. We discuss about the main strategies implemented by those.
Options
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the last Section \ref{Conclusion} we try to define a guideline for detecting vulnerabilities. 
  \item In the last Section \ref{Conclusion} we give an overview, defining the suitable cases which 
the tools work better.
  \item In the last section \ref{Conclusion} we propose a real case.
\end{itemize}


\section{Releted Works}

\section{Vulnerabilities in Solidity}
\label{Vulnerabilities}
An overview of classification of Vulnerabilities in Solidity is given in this section. 
Classifications by scholars and community taxonomies are the strating point for drowing our own classification. 
These knoledges are used for having our own classification; we depicted which ones are the most relevant 
vulnerabilities for our work.
The term vulnerability is used in a similar sense than is common in computer security. 
It refers to a weakness or limitation of a smart contract that may result in
security problems. 
A vulnerability represents even the way the attacker can exploit the contract. 
This includes locked or stolen
resources, breaches of confidentiality or data integrity, and state
changes in the environment of smart contracts that were not
detected by developers or users, therefor they possibly be exploited by a malicious part.
\subsection{Solidity Vulnerabilities and real-world examples}
\label{sec:Vulenerabilities:Definifinition}

\subsection{Vulnerabilities Classification and examples}
\label{sec:Vulnerabilities:Classification}
We summeries 10 different Vulnerabilities, providing a definition and a real-world example.
\paragraph{Reentrancy} It is one of the vulnerabilities much more exploited during the recent year. 
Many attacks occured and could steal great amount of many to vulnerable protocol. 
A reentrancy attack can occur when a function makes an external call to another untrusted contract 
before it resolves any effects. 
A recursive call back to the original function is made by the attacker, before 
the function could updated the state of the state of the variables. 
The goal is repeating interactions that would have otherwise not run after the effects were resolved. 
The function withdaw, line 8 to 16 \autoref{lst:Reentrancy}, implements this bug, because the balance of the user is updated after the call. 
The attacker can run multiple the function withdaw without updating the balance, withrawing all the funds.
\begin{lstlisting} [language=Solidity, caption={Reentrancy}, label={lst:Reentrancy}]
contract EtherStore {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    ...
    //vulnerable function exploited by the attacker
    function withdraw() public {
        uint bal = balances[msg.sender];
        require(bal > 0);

        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: bal}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");

        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
    ...
}
  
\end{lstlisting}
\paragraph{Unexpected Ether balance} An exploites can generated a Dos attack when the smart contract strictly assume a specific token balance. 
It is always possible to forcibly send ether to a contract (without triggering its fallback function), using selfdestruct, or by mining to the account. 
A common practice for detecting this bug is checking the invariant. 
Smart contracts which manage ERC20token, currenciens built on the blockchain, keep track of the total supplay. 
This is an example of invariant.

\paragraph{Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee} The definition of delegatecall is given by \cite{SolDocs}. 
Delegatecall is a special variant of a message call. 
It is identical to a message call apart from the fact that the code at the target address is executed in the context of the calling contract and msg.sender and msg.value do not change their values.
As a result of the context-preserving nature of DELEGATECALL, building vulnerability-free custom libraries isn't as easy as one might think. 
The code in libraries themselves can be secure and vulnerability-free; however, when run within the context of another application new vulnerabilities can arise.
An example is the use of a function call to send Ether, which could cause the execution of the
fallback function of a malicious attacker. The consequence can be a reentrancy attack.
\paragraph{Overflows \& Underflows} The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) defineds fixed-size data types for integers. 
An example is the identifier uint8, unsign integer over 8 bit, for variables means the variable can only store numbers in the range [0,255].
The attacker can craft the input value of a vulnerable contract's function in order to force a specific operation. 
In the contract TimeLock in \autoref{lst:ArithmeticOp}, an attacker could forge a parameter of the function function increaseLockTime, 
in oder to set lockTime to 0 because of Overflows. So it can call withraw and passing the require at line 17.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Solidity,caption={Overflows \& Underflows},label={lst:ArithmeticOp}]
contract TimeLock {
  
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    mapping(address => uint) public lockTime;
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        lockTime[msg.sender] = now + 1 weeks;
    }
    
    function increaseLockTime(uint _secondsToIncrease) public {
        lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease;
    }
    
    function withdraw() public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] > 0);
        require(now > lockTime[msg.sender]);
        msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Transaction Order Dependence}
\paragraph{Block Timestamp Manipulation}
\paragraph{Unchecked CALL Return Values}
\paragraph{Race Conditions / Front Running}

\section{Methodologies implemented by security analysis tools}
\label{MethodologiesForTools}
\paragraph{Static analysis} refers to a class of methods that examine
the source code or bytecode of a contract without execut-
ing it. Most methods listed below are static.
\paragraph{Dynamic analysis} means to observe a contract while
executing (parts of) it in the original context.
\paragraph{Disassembling} means to translate EVM bytecode into bet-
ter readable assembly language, where machine operations
and storage addresses are represented symbolically.
\paragraph{Decompilation} is the process of transforming EVM byte-
code to a more compact representation on a higher abstrac-
tion level (like intermediate or Solidity code) to enhance
the readability of the code or to ease data ﬂow analysis.
\paragraph{Control ﬂow graph (CFG)} is a directed graph, where the
basic blocks of a program serve as the nodes. An arc
connects node A with node B if it is possible that block B
gets executed immediately after block A. The arc may be
labeled by the condition under which this path is chosen.
\paragraph{Formal veriﬁcation} means veriﬁcation by formal methods
with the aim of proving or disproving system properties
rigorously. As a prerequisite, all components referenced
by such a property as well as their behavior must have
been speciﬁed formally. E.g., to verify properties of smart
contracts on bytecode level formally, we need a formal
speciﬁcation of the EVM and of the properties.
\paragraph{Dynamic CFG} is similar to a CFG with the difference that
arcs indicate the actual control ﬂow encountered during a
particular execution of the code.
\paragraph{Model checking} is a technique for automatically verifying
correctness properties of ﬁnite-state systems. It requires a
model of the system which is then checked against a given
speciﬁcation.
\paragraph{Call graph} is a directed graph, where the nodes are
functions. There is an arc from node A to node B if
function A calls function B.
\paragraph{Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)}represents the syntactic struc-
ture of Solidity code as a tree. It occurs as an intermediate
product when compiling Solidity to bytecode. Often, it is
better suited for analyzing Solidity code.
\paragraph{Symbolic execution} means to execute code using symbols
instead of concrete values for the variables. Operations
on these symbols lead to algebraic terms, and conditional
statements give rise to propositional formulas that char-
acterize the branches. A particular part of the code is
reachable if the conjunction of formulas on the path to this
part is satisﬁable, which can be checked by SMT-solvers.
