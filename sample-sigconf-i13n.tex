\begin{abstract}
Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that enables users to communicate in a trust-less manner. 
The most prominent change brought by this technology is the mode of business between organizations: they do not need anymore a trusted third party. 
It is a distributed ledger technology based on a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. 
Since Bitcoin was deployed, many blockchain systems have been born with more capabilities, which have allowed them to fit many
different use cases. Smart Contracts, which are programs running on blockchain systems, could extend the potentiality of blockchain
from a platform for financial transactions to an all-purpose utility.
The development of innovative and prominent applications is a consequence of them, such as NFT marketplaces, music royalty tracking, supply chain and logistics monitoring, voting mechanism, 
cross-border payments, and many others.
Finding bugs and vulnerabilities in them is necessary for assuring their correct behaviour. 
This paper deals with the way for finding the vulnerabilities in Ethereum blockchain-based smart contracts. We review related works regarding 
the classification of the most common vulnerabilities and tools which support their detection of them.

\section{Introduction}
Nowadays, the major platform for decentralized decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) 
and applications (dApps) is Ethereum. It can be described as the "internet of Blockchain".
Its ecosystem consists of the underlying blockchain, a large
variety of smart contracts deployed on it, a wide range of
valuable assets. 

This growing technology has attaracted many investors, indeed, according \href{https://www.coingecko.com/}{CoinGeko}, 
the crypto market's value is standing around \$2 trillion.
On the other hand, interest in such a market has grown even among malicious attackers. 
Attacks such as the “Parity Wallet Hack” and the “Decentralized Autonomous Organization Attack” cost millions of dollars simply because of 
naive bugs in the smart contract code. Blockchain and smart contract technologies have multiple aims, but unfortunately, new applications 
based on them still contain bugs and multiple vulnerabilities, which cause 
several issues for the end-users. Most of the use of this technology relates to finance or certifications, therefore integrity, 
authentication and authorisation in transactions are mandatory. 

The research field behind blockchain technology is growing, as well as the one concerning 
its security and accordingly, many analysis tools were developed. 
These incorporate various strategies for performing the analyses, concerning the technical aspects of smart contracts, 
so these would work differently according to the object of the analysis. 

Among the many aspects of smart contract, our systematic
literature review focuses on studies related to vulnerabilities and 
analysis tools for their detection. We will try to give an answer to the following 
research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which are the main vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts?
    \item Which methodologies are implemented by analysis tools?
    \item How should we behave for the detection of Vulnerabilities?
\end{itemize}

In Section \ref{RelatedWorks}, we compare the actual papers and works regarding this topic. 
Section \ref{Vulnerabilities} explains the objective of our analysis: Smart Contracts Vulnerabilities. 
We give a taxonomy for the main vulnerabilities regarding Solidity. The classification of analysis tools 
is shown in Section \ref{tools}. We discuss about the main strategies implemented by those.
Options
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the last Section \ref{Conclusion} we try to define a guideline for detecting vulnerabilities. 
  \item In the last Section \ref{Conclusion} we give an overview, defining the suitable cases which 
the tools work better.
  \item In the last section \ref{Conclusion} we propose a real case.
\end{itemize}



\section{Releted Works}
\label{RelatedWorks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Papers about vulenrabilities detection for defing a taxonomy
  \item papers regarding comperison between tools
  \item papers of the tools that we want to have a Look
\end{itemize}
\citet{SystematicReviewVuln} 

\section{Vulnerabilities in Solidity}
\label{Vulnerabilities}
\section{Security analysis tools}
I create a table with the most common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, arithmetic operations, 
DOS, self distruction. Post some codes.
\label{tools}
I explain the most typologies of tools.
Tools with and without specification.
Fuzzers, symbolic analysis, formal specification.
Level of abstraction of the tools.
\section{Conclusion}
\label{Conclusion}
I would propose 3 options:
\begin{itemize}
  \item propose a real case of analysis: I select a real wolrd exploit and I use the tools for analyses it.
  \item give a guideline for developers, how they should behave. So having a look of vulenrabilities and using the cited tools.
  \item an overview of the tools relating with the vulnerabilities.
\end{itemize}
